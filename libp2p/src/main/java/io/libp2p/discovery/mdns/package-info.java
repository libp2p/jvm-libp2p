/**
 * Java code in this package is derived from the JmDNS project.
 *
 * <p>JmDNS is a Java implementation of multi-cast DNS and can be used for service registration and
 * discovery in local area networks. JmDNS is fully compatible with Apple's Bonjour. The project was
 * originally started in December 2002 by Arthur van Hoff at Strangeberry. In November 2003 the
 * project was moved to SourceForge, and the name was changed from JRendezvous to JmDNS for legal
 * reasons. Many thanks to Stuart Cheshire for help and moral support. In 2014, it was been moved
 * from Sourceforge to Github by Kai Kreuzer with the kind approval from Arthur and Rick.
 *
 * <p><a href="https://github.com/jmdns/jmdns/">https://github.com/jmdns/jmdns/</a> JmDNS was
 * originally licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License as jRendevous. It was re-released
 * under the Apache License, Version 2.0 in 2005. It is under those terms it is reused here.
